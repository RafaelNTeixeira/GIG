# Logical Architecture

To achieve a better project organization, along with a better understanding of the functionality of our app, we divided our application in five different logical sections:
- **`components:`** Contains components/widgets that allows us to maintain a good app structure and improve productivity by avoiding having to create repeatedly the same code structures
- **`logs:`** Responsible for the authentication of the clients of the app. Manages the log in and registration of the client
- **`model:`** Manages each structure of our database
- **`displays:`** Responsible for the interaction between the user and the application, and the creation of the displays
- **`database:`** Works as a cloud for saving and retrieving useful data. Responsible for the interconnection between the firebase server and the models of the application
